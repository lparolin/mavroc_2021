# Use of probabilistic graphical models for online map validation

This repo contains the code for the paper "Use of probabilistic graphical models for online map validation" submitted to the Second Workshop on Online Map Validation and Road Model Creation [(MaVRoC)](https://map-validation.github.io/) as part of the [32nd IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium](https://2021.ieee-iv.org/). 

The notebook was originally developed with the google collaboratory tool.
